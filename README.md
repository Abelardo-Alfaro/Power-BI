# Power-BI

<h2>Description</h2>

Power BI is a business intelligence tool developed by Microsoft that allows users to analyze and visualize data from various sources in a simple and interactive way. With Power BI, users can create reports, dashboards, and interactive visualizations that help them understand and communicate insights from their data.<br/><br/>

Power BI connects to a wide range of data sources, including Excel spreadsheets, cloud-based and on-premises data sources, and big data sources such as Hadoop and Spark. Once connected to a data source, users can transform and shape the data to meet their needs, and then create visualizations using a variety of charts, graphs, and other visual elements.<br/><br/>

That being said, below is a Dashboard that I have created to serve as an example to show distinct and creative power bi dashboards could be, as well as inspire other BI analyst and collaborate with those who are interested.

All data is invented and is free to use to practice and redistribute.
